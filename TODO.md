# Hana Plugins To Do

* fix up marked up To Do's
* review tags plugin:
    *  should they only be references to files, rather than sythetized files? **no, because then content breaks as templates get applied…?**
    *  should sort/reverse be left to templating? Seems arbitrary
* Give collections plugin a 'limit' option, for producing short collections
* fix titles plugin

* minify plugin (html, css, js)
* combine js./css in single file plugin (webpack?)
* autoprefix plugin
* watch plugin
* serve plugin
* micropub plugin
* WebSub
* “sidematter” - fontmatter in separate files. Addition to front matter plugin

* git plugin
* rss source plugin
* hyde import wrapper/plugin
* s3 deploy plugin (ability to set s3 metadata & update only changed files)
